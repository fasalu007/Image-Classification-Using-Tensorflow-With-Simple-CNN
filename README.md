# Image-classification-using-tensorflow-with-simple-CNN
It is a simple image classification model build up using tensorflow, a Python-friendly open source library for numerical computation that makes machine learning and developing neural networks faster and easier.
Here I used images of Cat and Dog.
Each classes have 1000 images 
Which is downloaded from Kaggle dataset
